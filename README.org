* Argus

Argus is used for building automated agents online. I use it for watching for
events, monitoring pages, and performing simple web tasks. It's similar to
IFTTT, Zapier, or Huginn - but built with Javascript and Node both as a learning exercise
and because it's easier for me to hack on (I don't grok Ruby).
